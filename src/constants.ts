    detail: `‚Ä¢ Increased client side scroll performance by 90% by refactoring components causing layout thrashing from a O(n) DOM read and write solution to O(1).

          ‚Ä¢ Decreased perceived application load time by 95% with Electron by showing a splash screen window while launching background processes. Once all processes are ready, the client rendering process starts and once mounted sends an IPC message to the main process. This causes the splash screen window to animate into the client, creating a seamless transition between initial startup and full application load.

          ‚Ä¢ Increased engineer efficiency and codebase testing by creating the first reducer and middleware unit tests and briefing the team on implementation and best practices.

          ‚Ä¢ Developed various UI components with complex state management and animations using libraries including React, React Springs, Redux, GraphQL Apollo and more.`
